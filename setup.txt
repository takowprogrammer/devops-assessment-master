Step 1:
   Create the self-hosted runner on GitHub:
   Go to your GitHub repository settings.
   Click on "Actions" in the left-hand menu, then select the "Runners" tab.
   Click on "New runner" and follow the instructions to create a new self-hosted runner.
   During this process, you will get a unique registration token which you will use to register the runner


Step 2:
   Run the following Docker command to start the runner container:
    docker run -d --name github-runner -e REPO_URL=https://github.com/takowprogrammer/devops-assessment-master -e RUNNER_NAME=self-hosted-runner -e 
    RUNNER_TOKEN=enter-runner-token -e RUNNER_WORKDIR=_work 
    -e LABELS=java,maven myoung34/github-runner:latest

The runner will be triggered whenever code is pushed to the repository
